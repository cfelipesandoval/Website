Hey! I'm Felipe and I have been working on my PhD in ECE at Georgia Tech's <b>Low Frequency Lab</b>. I'm very interested in <b>Electromagnetics</b> theory and design.

I was previously part of the <b>Computational Quantum Electromagnetics Lab</b> at Purdue and competed with the <b>Purdue Space Program Student Launch team</b> for 3 years.

I play the <b>Piano</b> and <b>Guitar</b> on my free time. Performing on-stage has been some of my best experiences. Contact me if you want to jam in the Atlanta area.
