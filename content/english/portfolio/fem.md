The Project
</h4>

For my capstone at Purdue, I worked on creating a Finite Element Method for Electromagnetics tool for the Computational Quantum Electromagnetics lab. The goal was to make an easily accesible tool that could calculate all the possible modes that may propagate in specific geometries.

<br>How I made it
</h4>

To build up to the final 3D Potential Based tool, I began working my way up to understand the FEM for electromagnetics starting with the 1D case. 

A lot of the work was based off of Jin's textbook THEORY AND COMPUTATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS.
