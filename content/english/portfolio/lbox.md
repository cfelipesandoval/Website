The Project
</h4>

For the Purdue Space Program club, I set out to design a box to ignite our team's launch vehicle. The goal was to make a simple circuit that could deliver enough current with a remote controlled igniter. I thought encasing the product in a [NASA Lunch Box](https://www.amazon.com/Aquarius-NASA-Logo-Tin-Fun/dp/B078Y34WGR/ref=asc_df_B078Y34WGR?mcid=24c90d14566b35f9b7fc1e0912452b78&hvocijid=4776079089826065524-B078Y34WGR-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4776079089826065524&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052900&hvtargid=pla-2281435178298&psc=1) would be fitting, thus naming it the "Launch Box".

Design & Results
</h4>

I designed a circuit to include a garage door opener to be used as a remote control unit.

My goal was to gut the circuit board from one of the off the shelf controllers and add a key functionality to it.  

I had to drill a hole on the case I got, and the result looked like this

Here is a sample of a ground test I succesfully did.
