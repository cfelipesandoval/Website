Why I Made This
</h4>

Due to the pandemic, the event of 2020 (and some time after), we were all under strict restrictions to not have large gatherings. Regardless of that, I still wanted to give one of my best friends a great birthday gift. So I made this unique rendition of "Happy Birthday", with additional singing not present in the original.

The Music
</h4>

For this project, I played the Piano, guitars, and some additional percussion. The amazing Sarah helped me out with the vocals. This was my first succesful recorded performance of this form, and had a ton of fun making it. The project took approximately a week of work to finish.
