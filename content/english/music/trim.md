Why We Made This
</h4>

Being part of the Tri-M Music Honor Society during High School was an awesome experience. I got to perform a lot on stage with my friends and amazing musicians. At the end of the academic year, every senior gets a 10-minute spot to perform a song of their choosing with the help of the other members. My Senior year ended with the event of the decadeâ€”the Covid Pandemic, and we had to come up with an alternative to a live-performance. This video is what we created.

The Music and Video
</h4>

With a few of my fellow Seniors, Camilo and Chang-Yu, we decided to each perform our songs together, and recorded our parts individually, edited them, and came up with this video. We created a medley of three relatively unconventionally mixed songs, <b>The Pot by Tool</b>, <b>Rosanna by Toto</b>, and our rendition of <b>Autumn Leaves</b>.

In this performance I played the piano and guitar, Camilo the drums, and Chang-Yu the Saxophone. I also did the video editing. This project was very difficult to pull off, taking a month or so to complete during the pandemic, but it came out awesome.
